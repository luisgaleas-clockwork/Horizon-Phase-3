                    <p className="lead">Canadian rapper and vocalist Drake sustained a high-level commercial presence shortly after he
                      hit
                      the scene in 2006, whether with his own chart-topping releases or a long string of guest appearances on hits
                      by
                      the likes of Lil Wayne, Rihanna, and A$AP Rocky. Thanks to his introspective rap style, his sensitive R&B
                      crooning, and his gold-touch songwriting, each one of his albums -- from 2011's Take Care to 2018's Scorpion
                      --
                      topped charts worldwide, and his singles, like the Grammy-winning "Hotline Bling," and many mixtapes did as
            well.</p>
